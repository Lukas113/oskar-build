## OSKAR Binaries for Linux Systems

This repo builds binaries for debian based systems (Debian, Ubuntu (including all its flavours and derivatives)) for [OSKAR](https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR), a SKA radio astronomy simulation software.

## Installation on Debian (Ubuntu)


This will download precompiled binares for Ubuntu Linux with the standard gcc compiler and put them in a user space folder, meaning no sudo rights are necessary.

```shell
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i4Ds/oskar-build/master/install-package.sh | bash 
```
